•	3 1/2 to 4 cups bread flour, plus more for rolling (Chef's Note: Using bread flour will give you a much crisper crust. If you can't find bread flour, you can substitute it with all-purpose flour which will give you a chewier crust.) 
•	1 teaspoon sugar 
•	1 envelope instant dry yeast 
•	2 teaspoons kosher salt 
•	1 1/2 cups water, 110 degrees F 
•	2 tablespoons olive oil, plus 2 teaspoons 
Directions 
1.	Combine the bread flour, sugar, yeast and kosher salt in the bowl of a stand mixer and combine. 
2.	While the mixer is running, add the water and 2 tablespoons of the oil and beat until the dough forms into a ball. 
3.	If the dough is sticky, add additional flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the dough comes together in a solid ball. If the dough is too dry, add additional water, 1 tablespoon at a time. 
4.	Scrape the dough onto a lightly floured surface and gently knead into a smooth, firm ball. 
5.	Grease a large bowl with the remaining 2 teaspoons olive oil, add the dough, cover the bowl with plastic wrap and put it in a warm area to let it double in size, about 1 hour. 
6.	Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and divide it into 2 equal pieces. Cover each with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let them rest for 10 minutes.
